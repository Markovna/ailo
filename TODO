TODO:

*  Add material class that contains shader and texture.

*  Do not specify vertex input when creating a graphics pipeline. Instead,
   the vulkan pipeline object should be created and cached when calling
   draw function after binding the vertex buffer. Because descriptor set
   is using pipeline layout when binding, the actual vulkan descriptor
   binding api should also be called during draw. It will also allow to
   not specify descriptor set layout when creating the pipeline.
